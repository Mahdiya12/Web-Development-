                    1. Best of Bangladesh
                </h2>

                <img src="kacchi.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    Bangladeshi food is bold, rich, and unforgettable. At the top is Kacchi Biriyani—tender mutton,
                    buttery rice, and soft
                    potatoes layered with spices and slow-cooked to perfection. It’s festive, aromatic, and totally
                    addictive.

                    Don’t miss Shorshe Ilish (hilsa in mustard sauce), Bhuna Khichuri with beef curry, and the tangy
                    street favorite,
                    Fuchka. One bite, and you’re hooked for life.

                </h2>

                <img src="dosa.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    Dosa is a golden, paper-thin crepe made from fermented rice and lentil batter—crispy on the outside,
                    soft inside, and
                    totally addictive. It's often stuffed with spicy mashed potatoes (Masala Dosa) and served with
                    coconut chutney and tangy
                    sambar.

                    Hot, crispy, and full of flavor, dosa is more than breakfast—it's a South Indian obsession loved
                    across India and
                    beyond.
